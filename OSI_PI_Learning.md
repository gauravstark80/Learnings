OSI PI System:
----------------
The PI System is a software suite developed by OSIsoft that is used for real-time data collection, analysis, and visualization. It is a widely used platform for managing industrial data and is used in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, energy, and utilities.

The PI System consists of several components, including:

PI Server:
The PI Server is the core component of the PI System. It is a data infrastructure that provides a centralized repository for storing and managing real-time and historical data.

PI Interfaces:
PI Interfaces are software components that collect data from various sources, such as sensors, control systems, and databases. They are used to connect the PI System to a wide variety of industrial data sources.

PI Clients:
PI Clients are software applications that provide user interfaces for accessing and analyzing PI System data. They include applications for data visualization, reporting, and analysis.

PI Asset Framework (AF):
PI AF is a hierarchical data model that provides a way to organize and contextualize PI System data. It is used to define relationships between data sources and to provide context for data analysis.

PI Web API:
PI Web API is a web service that provides a way to access PI System data and functionality over the internet. It is used to integrate PI System data into web-based applications.

Overall, the PI System is a comprehensive platform for managing and analyzing industrial data. Its components work together to provide a scalable and flexible solution for collecting, storing, and analyzing real-time and historical data.
