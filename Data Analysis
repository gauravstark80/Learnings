PIVOT:
PIVOT rotates a table-valued expression by turning the unique values from one column in the expression into multiple columns in the output.

A good data model offers the following benefits:

Data exploration is faster.
Aggregations are simpler to build.
Reports are more accurate.
Writing reports takes less time.
Reports are easier to maintain in the future.

Providing set rules for what makes a good data model is difficult because all data is different, and the usage of that data varies. Generally, a smaller data model is better because it performs faster and will be simpler to use. However, defining what a smaller data model entails is equally as problematic because it's a heuristic and subjective concept.

Typically, a smaller data model is composed of fewer tables and fewer columns in each table that the user can see. If you import all necessary tables from a sales database, but the total table count is 30 tables, the user will not find that intuitive. Collapsing those tables into five tables make the data model more intuitive to the user, whereas if the user opens a table and finds 100 columns, they might find it overwhelming. Removing unneeded columns to provide a more manageable number increases the likelihood that the user reads all column names. To summarize, you should aim for simplicity when designing your data models.
